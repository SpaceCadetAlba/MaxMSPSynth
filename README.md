# MaxMSPSynth
A Max MSP Synthesiser patch.

Implemented in 2017 as a deliverable for David Moore's Audio Programming and Effects Module at Glasgow Caledonian University during 3rd year of BSc in Audio Systems Engineering.

It's a bit rough (it is a 3rd year undergrad project) - but there is a bunch in there:
- DX7 style FM synthesis which takes MIDI in.
- A sequencer which outputs MIDI.
- A 'random' melody generator with definable parameters (key, velocity, bpm, octave) and MIDI out.
- A 'free oscillating' digital modular synthesiser.
- Preset save and recall.
